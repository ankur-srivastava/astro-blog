Astro is a tool to build web sites that load faster because they ship less JavaScript."

To build a faster website you need to ship less code. Astro is a kind of static site builder that delivers 
lightning-fast performance with a modern developer experience.

With Astro you can build your site using your own framework like React, Vue or just HTML + JavaScript. 
Astro then renders the entire page to static HTML, removing all JavaScript from your final build by default.

If there is a real need for some Javscript component, Astro loads it when it's visible.

It supports all the npm packages, CSS modules etc and is SEO enabled.
 
Astro works like a static site generator which means it will generate a static HTML site for you during build, 
with almost no Javascript. It's pretty obvious that this will be much faster compared to a site with Javascript.

When a component, like add to cart or carousel, needs some JavaScript, it loads that component. 
The rest of your site continues to exist as static, lightweight HTML. This new approach to web architecture 
is called islands architecture.
